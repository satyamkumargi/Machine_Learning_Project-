# Machine_Learning_Project-

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn in a telecom company. Customer churn, or the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company, is a critical metric for telecom companies as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By predicting which customers are likely to churn, telecom companies can take proactive measures to retain them, such as offering incentives or targeted marketing campaigns.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical data on telecom customers including various features such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and account information. Additionally, the dataset includes a churn indicator which serves as the target variable for our machine learning models.
